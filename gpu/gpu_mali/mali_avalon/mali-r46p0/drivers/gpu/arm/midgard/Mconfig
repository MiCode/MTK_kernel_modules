	  All calls to the simulated hardware will complete immediately as if the hardware

	  This option will cause kbase to set up the GPU mapping of imported

	  behavior, then the dma-buf is mapped on import, by adding cache
	  maintenance where MALI_DMA_BUF_MAP_ON_DEMAND would do the mapping,
	  including a cache flush.

	  This option might work-around issues related to missing cache
	  flushes in other drivers. This only has an effect for clients using
	  UK 11.18 or older. For later UK versions it is not possible.

	  Enabling this feature on supported GPUs will let the driver powering
	  on/off the GPU core stack independently without involving the Power

	  integration of the PDC to the Mali GPU is known to be problematic.
	  This feature is currently only supported on t-Six and t-HEx GPUs.

	  PAGE_MIGRATION_OVERRIDE is disabled.

config LARGE_PAGE_SUPPORT

	depends on BACKEND_KERNEL
	default y
	help
	  Rather than allocating all GPU memory page-by-page, allow the system
	  to decide whether to attempt to allocate 2MB pages from the kernel.
	  This reduces TLB pressure and helps to prevent memory fragmentation.

	  Note that this option only enables the support for the module parameter
	  and does not necessarily mean that 2MB pages will be used automatically.
	  This depends on GPU support.

	  If in doubt, say Y.

	  Select this option to enable additional checking and reporting on the

	  This will add a 3s timeout to all sync fence waits in the Mali
	  driver, so that when work for Mali has been waiting on a sync fence
	  for a long time a debug message will be printed, detailing what fence
	  is causing the block, and which dependent Mali atoms are blocked as a
