menuconfig MALI_KUTF
	bool "Mali Kernel Unit Test Framework"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD
	default y
	help
	  Enables MALI testing framework. To compile it as a module,
	  choose M here - this will generate a single module called kutf.

config MALI_IRQ_LATENCY
	bool "Mali GPU IRQ latency measurement"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_DEBUG && MALI_KUTF
	default y
	help
	  This option will build a test module mali_kutf_irq_test that
	  can determine the latency of the Mali GPU IRQ on your system.
	  Choosing M here will generate a single module called mali_kutf_irq_test.

config MALI_CLK_RATE_TRACE_PORTAL
	bool "Mali GPU Clock Trace Test portal"
	depends on MALI_MIDGARD && MALI_DEBUG && MALI_KUTF
	default y
	help
	  This option will build a test module mali_kutf_clk_rate_trace_test_portal
	  that can test the clocks integration into the platform and exercise some
	  basic trace test in the system. Choosing M here will generate a single
	  module called mali_kutf_clk_rate_trace_test_portal.
