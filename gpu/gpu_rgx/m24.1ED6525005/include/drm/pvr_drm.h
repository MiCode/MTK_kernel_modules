 * IMPORTANT:
 * All structures below are designed to be the same size when compiled for 32
 * and/or 64 bit architectures, i.e. there should be no compiler inserted
 * padding. This is achieved by sticking to the following rules:
 * 1) only use fixed width types
 * 2) always naturally align fields by arranging them appropriately and by using
 *    padding fields when necessary
 *
 * These rules should _always_ be followed when modifying or adding new
 * structures to this file.
