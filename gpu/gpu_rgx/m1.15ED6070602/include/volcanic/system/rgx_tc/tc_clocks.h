/*
 * The core clock speed is passed through a multiplier depending on the TC
 * version.
 *
 * On TC_ES1: Multiplier = x3, final speed = 270MHz
 * On TC_ES2: Multiplier = x6, final speed = 540MHz
 * On TCF5:   Multiplier = 1x final speed = 45MHz
 *
 *
 * The base (unmultiplied speed) can be adjusted using a module parameter
 * called "sys_core_clk_speed", a number in Hz.
 * As an example:
 *
 * PVR_SRVKM_PARAMS="sys_core_clk_speed=60000000" /etc/init.d/rc.pvr start
 *
 * would result in a core speed of 60MHz xMultiplier.
 *
 *
 * The memory clock is unmultiplied and can be adjusted using a module
 * parameter called "sys_mem_clk_speed", this should be the number in Hz for
 * the memory clock speed.
 * As an example:
 *
 * PVR_SRVKM_PARAMS="sys_mem_clk_speed=100000000" /etc/init.d/rc.pvr start
 *
 * would attempt to start the driver with the memory clock speed set to 100MHz.
 *
 *
 * Same applies to the system interface clock speed, "sys_sysif_clk_speed".
 * Needed for TCF5 but not for TC_ES2/ES1.
 * As an example:
 *
 * PVR_SRVKM_PARAMS="sys_sysif_clk_speed=45000000" /etc/init.d/rc.pvr start
 *
 * would attempt to start the driver with the system clock speed set to 45MHz.
 *
 *
 * All parameters can be specified at once, e.g.,
 * PVR_SRVKM_PARAMS="sys_mem_clk_speed=MEMORY_SPEED sys_core_clk_speed=CORE_SPEED sys_sysif_clk_speed=SYSIF_SPEED" /etc/init.d/rc.pvr start
